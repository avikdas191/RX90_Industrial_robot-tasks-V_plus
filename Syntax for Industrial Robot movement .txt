Syntax - SPEED speed_factor, r_speed_factor units ALWAYS
1) SPEED 50 ALWAYS - permanently set the robot speed at 50%. Set the nominal speed for subsequent robot motions.

2) OPENI - Open the robot gripper. It causes a BREAK in the current continuous-path motion and causes the 
hand to open immediately after the current motion completes

Syntax - APPRO location, distance
3) APPRO PEG, 50 - Start a robot motion toward a location defined relative to specified location

Syntax - MOVES location
4) MOVES PEG - Initiate a robot motion to the position and orientation described by the given location. 
MOVES causes a straight-line motion, during which no changes in configuration are permitted.

5) CLOSEI - Close the robot gripper. It causes a BREAK in the current continuous-path motion and 
causes the hand to close immediately after the current motion completes.

Syntax - DELAY time
6) DELAY 2 - It cause robot motion to stop for the specified time. It causes all robot motion to stop for
2 seconds and any pending hand operation to occur. Clears any temporary trajectory switches that may be set, 
and cancels any pending requests for configuration change.

Syntax - DEPART distance
7) DEPART 50 - Back away a safe distance. Start a robot motion away from the current location

8) APPRO PLACE, 50 - Start a robot motion toward a location defined relative to specified location

Syntax - MOVE location
9) MOVE PLACE - Initiate a robot motion to the position and orientation described by the given location. 
MOVE causes a joint-interpolated motion.

10) OPENI - Open the robot gripper.

11) DEPART 50 - Back away a safe distance.
